title: Getting in the swing of things   
---

Today was a good day.  Despite not making massive amounts of progress I felt like my pair and I moved at a rate we were both comfortable with.  I still struggle with embracing the "power of yet" but today I felt like I did better with not letting frustration get the better of me.  I am hoping this will lead to a better sleep tonight because last night I was fairly panicked about everything I didn't understand and could not still my mind! 

Other awesome things today was a challenging workshop with Dan looking at writing rspec for a class calculator - much harder than expected and I plan to go through the exercise again tomorrow morning to get a better handle on the concepts raised.  An early morning rehash this morning of yesterdays work was actually really helpful in stilling my mind and reassuring myself that I do have knowledge.  I reminded me that I am a better coder today than I was yesterday!!  We also had a great talk by Najaf Ali (https://www.happybearsoftware.com/) who spoke about how to start a successful career as a web application developer.  He was very entertaining and equally informative!  I took some notes that I should add here.

All and all a good day on the road to code.
