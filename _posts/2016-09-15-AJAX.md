end user: begins typing in their user city, he confidently hits the submit button
www.thermostat.com: grabs the city entered by end user and hands it to AJAX
AJAX: confidently takes this request in hand and shares it with the API, all the while www.thermostat.com patiently waits on screen.
API: finds the associated information and hands it back to AJAX
AJAX: sends it back to thermostat who displays
end user: thanks god that he doesn't have to look outside to check the weather.
