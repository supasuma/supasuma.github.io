##A simple story script about a humble thermostat depicting an AJAX call to a Weather API##

###In order of appearance:###

..***Will Power** as **End user**
..***Al Bino** as **AJAX**
..***Anita Bath** as **www.thermostat.com**
..***Anna Prentice** as **API http://api.wunderground.com/api/e0d820621ded8ea4/conditions/q/GB/London**
..***Walter Melon** as **JSON**

Guest appearance by Ophelia Payne as XML


**End user**: begins typing in their user city, he confidently hits the submit button

**www.thermostat.com:** grabs the city entered by end user and hands it to AJAX

**AJAX:** confidently takes this request in hand and shares it with the API, all the while www.thermostat.com patiently waits on screen.

**API:** finds the associated information and hands it to JSON who hops aboard AJAX

**AJAX:** Takes JSON and sends him back to thermostat who displays the relevant data from JSON

**End user:** Thanks the gods that he doesn't have to go outside to check the weather.
