The emotional roller coaster continues, but at least with my awareness and endeavour to be in control of how exciting this roller coaster gets.  Monday I had a great experience reminding me that I can assist peoples learning; and not just as the pair with the less knowledge, but helping someone else understand a concept they find difficult.  What a great feeling!  Now I'm even more assured that my questioning others and forcing them to explain their work has its benefits.    Today however was a reversal.  Today was all about refactoring bad code, and it is an absolute mind bender.   Extracting objects out into their own class when they are embedded in another, especially after a bad nights sleep, is incredibly frustrating.  I suppose I was in the fortunate position of being with someone who was quite competent so my day was spent just trying to understand what he was doing and why.  Still working on dealing with the feelings associated with this sort of situation but Iâ€™m getting there.
