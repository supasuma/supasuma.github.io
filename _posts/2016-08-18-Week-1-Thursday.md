title: mind dump

Just a quick mind dump about my day today.  Had a nice day as part of trio today and felt we were really getting into the groove of productive 'trio programming'.  I feel like I am getting a better handle of actually writing rspec tests but still struggle with understanding what I should be testing.  But I can feel better understanding coming, slowly but surely.  I seem to be saying slowly but surely a lot lately - which is a positive thing.  

Meditation and yoga gave me the resets I needed today and look forward to it becoming more ingrained in my daily life.
