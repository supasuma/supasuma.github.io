title:  Refactoring nightmares
---
Today was a hard day, but it was a good day.  Refactoring bad code is still bending my mind in all sorts of directions, but my pair and I found that perfect balance between frustration and jubilation!  Our coach Dan has also been great at reasurring us that we'll be repeating and practicing all the concepts we learn in the coming weeks. I continue to see the benefits of daily meditation and will endeavour to make sure I make it as much as possible.

I realise this sort of blog is meant to discuss the technical nature of coding and problems I encounter, however at this point I'm finding it more helpful as a mind-dump.
