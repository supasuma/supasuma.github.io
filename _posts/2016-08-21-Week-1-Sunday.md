title: One week in..
---

One week in and what an absolute whirlwind, a wonderful terrifying whirlwind.  I just pushed my final version of the weekend airport challenge to github with mixed emotions.  On the whole I really enjoyed the process as it really showed me how much I learnt this week - which genuinely amazed me.  A mistake I made was not following the pomodoro technique the second half of today... It unsurprisingly resulted in frustration and a bit of burn-out.  I realised if I have a schedule I need to stick to it and every weekend I need to set some time aside to actually get out of the house! Otherwise by the end of these 3 months I will be a mess.  So much to learn, not only about coding, but about myself and taking care of my mind & body.
